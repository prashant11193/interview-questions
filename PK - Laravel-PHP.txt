Laravel
    - Laravel is a PHP framework with expressive, elegant syntax. Laravel is the best choice for building modern, full-stack web applications. Laravel gives you robust tools for dependency injection, queues, real-time events, blade templating,and many more.


Dependency Injection
    
    - Service Container
        service container is a powerful tool for managing class dependencies and performing dependency injection. Dependency injection is a fancy phrase that essentially means this: class dependencies are "injected" into the class via the constructor or, in some cases, "setter" methods.
        e.g - repository is injected to retrieve users detail from a data source (app/repository/userrepository.php)
        
        Many of the classes we build in Laravel application receive their dependencies automatically via the container, including controllers, event listeners,
        middleware, and more. Additionally, we may type-hint dependencies in the handle method of queued jobs.

        we might type-hint the Illuminate\Http\Request object on our route definition so that we can easily access the current request.

        e.g
        use Illuminate\Http\Request;
        Route::get('/', function (Request $request) {});

        Almost all of your service container bindings will be registered within service providers.
        There is no need to bind classes into the container if they do not depend on any interfaces. The container does not need to be instructed on how to build these objects, since it can automatically resolve these objects using reflection.

        The service container fires an event each time it resolves an object. You may listen to this event using the resolving method
            use App\Services\Transistor;
            
            $this->app->resolving(Transistor::class, function ($transistor, $app) {
                // Called when container resolves objects of type "Transistor"...
            });
            
            $this->app->resolving(function ($object, $app) {
                // Called when container resolves object of any type...
            });

        Binding
        The singleton method binds a class or interface into the container that should only be resolved one time.
            use App\Services\Transistor;
            use App\Services\PodcastParser;
            
            $this->app->singleton(Transistor::class, function ($app) {
                return new Transistor($app->make(PodcastParser::class));
            });

        The scoped method binds a class or interface into the container that should only be resolved one time within a given Laravel request / job lifecycle.
        the scoped method will be flushed whenever the Laravel application starts a new "lifecycle", such as when a Laravel queue worker processes a new job.
            use App\Services\Transistor;
            use App\Services\PodcastParser;
            
            $this->app->scoped(Transistor::class, function ($app) {
                return new Transistor($app->make(PodcastParser::class));
            });

        You may also bind an existing object instance into the container using the instance method. The given instance will always be returned on subsequent calls into the container
            use App\Services\Transistor;
            use App\Services\PodcastParser;
            
            $service = new Transistor(new PodcastParser);
            
            $this->app->instance(Transistor::class, $service);


        If some of your class' dependencies are not resolvable via the container, you may inject them by passing them as an associative array into the makeWith method. For example, we may manually pass the $id constructor argument required by the Transistor service:

            use App\Services\Transistor;
            
            $transistor = $this->app->makeWith(Transistor::class, ['id' => 1]);

        If you are outside of a service provider in a location of your code that does not have access to the $app variable, you may use the App facade or the app helper to resolve a class instance from the container:

            use App\Services\Transistor;
            use Illuminate\Support\Facades\App;
            
            $transistor = App::make(Transistor::class);
            
            $transistor = app(Transistor::class);

Repositories in laravel
    - Helps keeping the code organized and avoiding duplication, as database-related logic is kept in one place. While this benefit is not immediately apparent in small
      projects, it becomes more observable in large-scale projects which have to be maintained for many years.
    - Steps to Create the Repository
        - let's define an interface to specify all the methods which the repository must declare.Instead of relying directly on the repository class, our controller will depend on the interface. This makes our code flexible because, if it's become necessary to make a change in the future, the controller remains unaffected. For instance, if we decided to outsource order management to a 3rd party application, we can build a new module that conforms to OrderRepositoryInterface's signature and swap the binding declarations and our controller will work exactly as expected - without touching a single line of code in the controller.
        1. create a new folder called Interfaces and add below code.
            <?php

            namespace App\Interfaces;

            interface OrderRepositoryInterface 
            {
                public function getAllOrders();
                public function getOrderById($orderId);
            }

        2. create a new folder called Repositories and add below code.
        
            <?php

            namespace App\Repositories;

            use App\Interfaces\OrderRepositoryInterface;
            use App\Models\Order;

            class OrderRepository implements OrderRepositoryInterface 
            {
                public function getAllOrders() 
                {
                    return Order::all();
                }

                public function getOrderById($orderId) 
                {
                    return Order::findOrFail($orderId);
                }
            }

            Apart from the flexibility provided by the interface, encapsulating queries in this manner has the added advantage that we don't have to duplicate queries throughout the application.
            If, in the future, we decide to retrieve only unfulfilled orders in the getAllOrders() function, we would only have to make a change in one place instead of tracking down all the places where Order::all() is declared.

        3. our repository in place, let's add some code to our controller.
            <?php

            namespace App\Http\Controllers;

            use App\Interfaces\OrderRepositoryInterface;
            use Illuminate\Http\JsonResponse;
            use Illuminate\Http\Request;
            use Illuminate\Http\Response;

            class OrderController extends Controller 
            {
                private OrderRepositoryInterface $orderRepository;

                public function __construct(OrderRepositoryInterface $orderRepository) 
                {
                    $this->orderRepository = $orderRepository;
                }

                public function index(): JsonResponse 
                {
                    return response()->json([
                        'data' => $this->orderRepository->getAllOrders()
                    ]);
                }

                public function show(Request $request): JsonResponse 
                {
                    $orderId = $request->route('id');

                    return response()->json([
                        'data' => $this->orderRepository->getOrderById($orderId)
                    ]);
                }
            }

            The code injects an OrderRepositoryInterface instance via the constructor and uses the relevant object's methods in each controller method.
            First, within the index() method, it calls the getAllOrders() method defined in the orderRepository to retrieve the list of orders and returns a response in JSON format.

        4. Bind the interface and the implementation
            The last thing we need to do is bind OrderRepository to OrderRepositoryInterface in Laravel's Service Container; we do this via a Service Provider. Create one using the following command.
                php artisan make:provider RepositoryServiceProvider

            Open app/Providers/RepositoryServiceProvider.php and update the register function
            public function register() 
            {
                $this->app->bind(OrderRepositoryInterface::class, OrderRepository::class);
            }
        
        5. Finally, add the new Service Provider to the providers array in config/app.php.
            'providers' => [
                // ...other declared providers
                App\Providers\RepositoryServiceProvider::class,
            ];

Blade
    - Blade is the simple & powerful templating engine that is included with Laravel. Blade templates are compiled into plain PHP code and cached until they are modified, meaning Blade adds essentially zero overhead to your application. Blade template files use the .blade.php file extension and are typically stored in the resources/views directory.
    Blade views may be returned from routes or controllers using the global view helper also data may be passed to the Blade view using the view helper's second argument:
    e.g
    Route::get('/', function () {
        return view('greeting', ['name' => 'Finn']);
    });
    Blade's {{ }} echo statements are automatically sent through PHP's htmlspecialchars function to prevent XSS attacks.
    If you do not want your data to be escaped, you may use the following syntax: Hello, {!! $name !!}.

Blade Directives
    - USe to control structures, such as conditional statements and loops.
    - 1. Conditional directives
            If Statements
            You may construct if statements using the @if, @elseif, @else, and @endif directives. For convenience, Blade also provides an @unless directive:
            e.g
                @unless (Auth::check())
                    You are not signed in.
                @endunless

            @isset and @empty directives
                @isset($records)
                    // $records is defined and is not null...
                @endisset
                
                @empty($records)
                    // $records is "empty"...
                @endempty

    - 2. Authentication Directives
        The @auth and @guest directives may be used to quickly determine if the current user is authenticated or is a guest
        e.g
            @auth
                // The user is authenticated...
            @endauth
            
            @guest
                // The user is not authenticated...
            @endguest
        
    - 3. Environment Directives
            You may check if the application is running in the production environment using the @production directive Or, you may determine if the application is running in a specific environment using the @env directive
            e.g
                @production
                    // Production specific content...
                @endproduction

                @env('staging')
                    // The application is running in "staging"...
                @endenv
                
                @env(['staging', 'production'])
                    // The application is running in "staging" or "production"...
                @endenv

    - 4. Section Directives
            You may determine if a template inheritance section has content using the @hasSection directive also You may use the sectionMissing directive to determine if a section does not have content.
            e.g
                @hasSection('navigation')
                    <div class="pull-right">
                        @yield('navigation')
                    </div>
                
                    <div class="clearfix"></div>
                @endif

                @sectionMissing('navigation')
                    <div class="pull-right">
                        @include('default-navigation')
                    </div>
                @endif

        - 5. Switch Statements
            Switch statements can be constructed using the @switch, @case, @break, @default and @endswitch directives.
                @switch($i)
                    @case(1)
                        First case...
                        @break
                
                    @case(2)
                        Second case...
                        @break
                
                    @default
                        Default case...
                @endswitch
            
        list of additional directives
            1. @checked  <input type="checkbox" name="active" value="active" @checked(old('active', $user->active)) />
            2. @selected <option value="{{ $version }}" @selected(old('version') == $version)>
            3. @disabled <button type="submit" @disabled($errors->isNotEmpty())>Submit</button>
            4. @readonly <input type="email" name="email" value="email@laravel.com" @readonly($user->isNotAdmin()) />
            5. @required <input type="text" name="title" value="title" @required($user->isAdmin()) />
            6. @include @include('shared.errors') // to include a blade files / sub view file
            7. @includeIf @includeIf('view.name', ['status' => 'complete'])



Eloquent
    Eloquent, an object-relational mapper (ORM) that makes it easier to interact with our database. When using Eloquent, each database table has a corresponding "Model" that is used to interact with that table. In addition to retrieving records from the database table, Eloquent models allow you to insert, update, and delete records from the table as well.

    e.g We may use the make:model Artisan command to generate a new model:
        php artisan make:model Flight --migration --factory --seed --controller --resource --requests -crR --policy

        # Shortcut to generate a model, migration, factory, seeder, policy, controller, and form requests...
        php artisan make:model Flight --all

        # Generate a pivot model...
        php artisan make:model Flight --pivot
        
Model
    Models generated by the make:model command will be placed in the app/Models directory.
    e.g
        <?php
 
        namespace App\Models;
         
        use Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Model;
         
        class Flight extends Model
        {
            #The table associated with the model.
            protected $table = 'my_flights';

            #The primary key associated with the table.
            protected $primaryKey = 'flight_id';

            #Indicates if the model's ID is auto-incrementing(Primary key).
            public $incrementing = false;

            #The data type of the auto-incrementing ID(Primary key).
            protected $keyType = 'string';

            #Indicates if the model should be timestamped.
            public $timestamps = false;

            #The storage format of the model's date columns.
            protected $dateFormat = 'U';

            #The database connection that should be used by the model.
            protected $connection = 'sqlite';

            #The model's default values for attributes.
            protected $attributes = [
                'delayed' => false,
            ];

            #The database connection that should be used by the model.
            protected $connection = 'sqlite';

            #The database connection that should be used by the model.
            protected $connection = 'sqlite';

            #The database connection that should be used by the model.
            protected $connection = 'sqlite';



        }


XSS attack
    - attackers look for vulnerabilities on a website that will let them inject malicious scripts into the website. Once attackers get their scripts injected, they can control the behavior of the victim’s site and steal user data.
    A simple XSS attack can occur on a vulnerable website that accepts user input via a GET parameter and displays the data on the webpage.

Prevention from XSS attack
    1. By passing the user input through PHP’s htmlspecialchars() function. Doing so escapes HTML tags and any scripts, causing the page to render the user input as plain text.
    e.g
    echo "Hello user, your current country is " . $_GET['country']; // vulnerable
    echo "Hello user, your current country is" + htmlspecialchars($_GET['country']); //non-vulnerable


    2. You can also prevent XSS attacks on a Laravel site using middleware.
    e.g
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $userInput = $request->all();
        array_walk_recursive($userInput, function (&$userInput) {
            $userInput = strip_tags($userInput);
        });
        $request->merge($userInput);
        return $next($request);
    }

    make use of middleware in route 
    e.g
    Route::middleware('XSS')->group(function() {
        Route::get('/product', 'ProductController@index');
    });


SQL 
Fetch nth highest salry from table 
    SELECT DISTINCT `salary` FROM `employees` ORDER BY `salary` DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;
    // limit 1 - will fetch only 1 record
    // offset 1 will discard the starting numbers of row mentioned here 1 row will be discarded and this will fetch 2nd highest salary employee

    -- Return 3rd highest salary with no regards of same salary. i.e. Brian Kernighan
    SELECT * FROM `employee` ORDER BY `salary` DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2;

    -- Return 3rd highest salary with distincation. Can return multiple rows matched.
    SELECT *
    FROM `employee`
    WHERE
        `Salary` = (SELECT DISTINCT `Salary`
            FROM `employee`
            ORDER BY `salary` DESC
         LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2
         )
    ;

    -- Return 3rd highest salary with distincation. Limiting to 1 result.
    SELECT *
    FROM `employee`
    WHERE
        `Salary` = (SELECT DISTINCT `Salary`
            FROM `employee`
            ORDER BY `salary` DESC
         LIMIT 1 OFFSET 2
         )
    LIMIT 1
    ;


What is Composer
    A Composer is a tool that incorporates all the dependencies and libraries. It helps to create a project with respect to its specified system and project. Third-party libraries can be installed in a project effortlessly utilizing composer. Composer is utilized to manage its conditions and the dependencies are noted in composer.
    It is designed in such a way that it will not only pull the required component or package you want in your PHP application. It also keeps the track of the dependencies of those required components or packages as well as creates the class map for the downloaded libraries. It automatically loads once and becomes available system-wide. It follows the DRY principle. DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) is a key principle in software engineering.

What is a Trait?
    Traits are a mechanism for code reuse in single inheritance languages such as PHP.
    A trait is intended to reduce some limitations of single inheritance by enabling a developer to reuse sets of methods freely in several independent classes living in different class hierarchies.
    In simple terms Traits is a group of methods that you want to include within another class. You can easily reuse that methods to another class. Trait is used to write same code again and again.
    Traits only extend multiple traits at the same time but can’t extend more than one class.
    E.g:
        Whenever we need to upload image then we can use this ImageTrait trait.
        
        Create a folder inside app directory named Traits and inside it create ImageTrait with verifyAndUpload() function.
            <?php
            namespace App\Traits;
            use Illuminate\Http\Request;

            trait ImageTrait {
                /**
                * @param Request $request
                * @return $this|false|string
                */
                public function verifyAndUpload(Request $request, $fieldname = 'image', $directory = 'images' ) {
                    if( $request->hasFile( $fieldname ) ) {
                        if (!$request->file($fieldname)->isValid()) {
                            flash('Invalid Image!')->error()->important();
                            return redirect()->back()->withInput();
                        }
                        return $request->file($fieldname)->store($directory, 'public');
                    }
                    return null;
                }
            }
        
        Create the controller that will use ImageTrait
            <?php
            namespace App\Http\Controllers;
            use Illuminate\Http\Request;
            use App\Item;
            use App\Traits\ImageTrait;

            class ItemController extends Controller
            {

How multiple inheritance is achieved in php ?
    PHP programming language doesn’t even support the multiple inheritance/inheritances. 
    PHP supports multiple inheritances only by using interfaces or Traits in PHP instead of classes so that we can implement it.
    
    Interface : Interfaces allow you to specify what methods a class should implement. Interfaces make it easy to use a variety of different classes in the same way. When one or more classes use the same interface, it is referred to as "polymorphism". Interfaces are declared with the interface keyword.

    Trait : Traits are used to declare methods that can be used in multiple classes. Traits can have methods and abstract methods that can be used in multiple classes, and the methods can have any access modifier (public, private, or protected). Traits are declared with the trait keyword.

    E.g: Trait Example
        <?php
        // Class Pavan
        class Pavan {
            public function sayhihello() {
                echo "Hey Hi Hello";
            }
        }

        // Trait for pavan
        trait forPavan {
            public function sayforp() {
                echo " Pavan";
            }
        }

        class Sample extends Pavan {
            use forPavan;
            public function pavanforNaruto() {
                echo "\npavanforNaruto";
            }
        }

        $test = new Sample();
        $test->sayhihello(); // Hey Hi Hello
        $test->sayforp();    // pavan
        $test->pavanforNaruto(); // pavanforNaruto

        ?>

        O/P:
            Hey Hi Hello Pavan
            pavanforNaruto

        Interface Example
        <?php
        
        interface C1 {
            public function insideC1();
        }

        interface B1 {
            public function insideB1();
        }

        class Multiple1 implements B1, C1 {
            // Function of the interface B1
            function insideB1() {
                echo "\n Hey now you are in the interface B1";
            }

            // Function of the interface C1
            function insideC1() {
                echo "\nHi buddy !! Now you are in the interface C1";
            }

            public function insidemultiple1() {
                echo "\nHeyaa You are in the inherited class";
            }
        }

        $Naruto = new multiple1();
        $Naruto->insideC1(); // Hi buddy !! Now you are in the interface C1
        $Naruto->insideB1(); // Hey now you are in the interface B1
        $Naruto->insidemultiple1(); // Heyaa You are in the inherited class
        ?>

Traits vs. Interfaces
    The main difference between the Traits and Interfaces in PHP is that the Traits define the actual implementation of each method within each class, so many classes implement the same interface but having different behavior, while traits are just chunks of code injected in a class. A class can implement more than one interface whereas it can extend only one class.


What is the difference between "==" and "===" operators in PHP?
The "==" operator checks whether the values of two variables are equal or not, while the "===" operator checks whether the values and data types of two variables are equal or not.

$a = 5; // integer
$b = '5'; // string

// using the == operator
if ($a == $b) {
  echo 'Values are equal';
} else {
  echo 'Values are not equal';
}
// Output: Values are equal

// using the === operator
if ($a === $b) {
  echo 'Values and data types are equal';
} else {
  echo 'Values and/or data types are not equal';
}
// Output: Values and/or data types are not equal


How do you convert a string to an array in PHP?
You can use the str_split() function to convert a string into an array of characters, or the explode() function to split a string into an array based on a delimiter.

$string = 'Hello, world!';
// using str_split() to convert string to array
$array1 = str_split($string);
print_r($array1);
// Output: Array ( [0] => H [1] => e [2] => l [3] => l [4] => o [5] => , [6] =>   [7] => w [8] => o [9] => r [10] => l [11] => d [12] => ! )

// using explode() to split string into array
$array2 = explode(',', $string);
print_r($array2);
// Output: Array ( [0] => Hello [1] =>  world! )


How do you reverse a string in PHP without using any built-in function?
You can use a loop to iterate over the characters of the string in reverse order and append them to a new string.
$string = 'Hello, world!';
$length = strlen($string);
$newString = '';

for ($i = $length - 1; $i >= 0; $i--) {
  $newString .= $string[$i];
}

echo $newString;
// Output: !dlrow ,olleH


Can you explain the difference between "require_once" and "include_once" in PHP?
Both require_once and include_once are used to include a file in PHP. The main difference between them is that require_once will produce a fatal error if the file cannot be included, while include_once will only produce a warning. Additionally, require_once checks if the file has already been included and will not include it again, while include_once will include the file every time it is called.



How do you implement an interface in PHP?
To implement an interface in PHP, you need to use the implements keyword followed by the interface name. Then you need to implement all the methods defined in the interface.
interface Logger {
    public function log($message);
}

class FileLogger implements Logger {
    public function log($message) {
        // Code to log the message to a file
    }
}

class DBLogger implements Logger {
    public function log($message) {
        // Code to log the message to a database
    }
}


What is the difference between "private" and "protected" in PHP?
The private and protected access modifiers are used to control the visibility of class properties and methods.
private properties and methods can only be accessed within the class that defines them.
protected properties and methods can be accessed within the class that defines them and any subclasses of that class.
class Person {
    private $name;
    protected $age;
    public function __construct($name, $age) {
        $this->name = $name;
        $this->age = $age;
    }
    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;  // Can only be accessed within the Person class
    }
    public function getAge() {
        return $this->age;  // Can be accessed within Person and any subclasses
    }
}

class Student extends Person {
    public function __construct($name, $age, $grade) {
        parent::__construct($name, $age);
        $this->grade = $grade;
    }
    
    public function getGrade() {
        return $this->grade;  // Can only be accessed within the Student class
    }
}

$person = new Person("John", 30);
echo $person->getName();  // Outputs "John"
echo $person->getAge();   // Outputs "30"

$student = new Student("Jane", 20, "A");
echo $student->getName();  // Outputs "Jane"
echo $student->getAge();   // Outputs "20"
echo $student->getGrade(); // Outputs "A"


Can you explain the difference between "abstract" and "interface" in PHP?
Both abstract classes and interfaces provide a way to define a set of methods that a class must implement.
An abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods, while an interface can only have abstract methods.
A class can only inherit from one abstract class, but it can implement multiple interfaces.
interface Shape {
    public function getArea();
}
abstract class AbstractShape {
    public function draw() {
        echo "Drawing shape...";
    }
    
    abstract public function getArea();
}

class Rectangle extends AbstractShape implements Shape {
    private $width;
    private $height;
    
    public function __construct($width, $height) {
        $this->width = $width;
        $this->height = $height;
    }
    
    public function getArea() {
        return $this->width * $this->height;
    }
}

$rectangle = new Rectangle(5, 10);
$rectangle->draw();    // Outputs "Drawing shape..."
echo $rectangle->getArea();  // Outputs "50"


How do you handle exceptions in PHP?
exceptions can be used to handle errors and other exceptional situations that may arise during the execution of a script. To throw an exception, you can use the throw keyword followed by an instance of the Exception class or a subclass of it. To catch an exception, you can use a try...catch block.
function divide($a, $b) {
    if ($b == 0) {
        throw new Exception("Division by zero");
    }
    return $a / $b;
}

try {
    echo divide(10, 0);
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Error: " . $e->getMessage();
}


What is a closure in PHP, and how is it used?
A closure in PHP is a function that can be assigned to a variable, passed as a parameter, or returned as a value from another function. Closures can be used to create anonymous functions and to define functions that use variables from the parent scope.
function multiply($factor) {
    return function($number) use ($factor) {
        return $number * $factor;
    };
}

$double = multiply(2);
$triple = multiply(3);

echo $double(5);   // Outputs 10
echo $triple(5);   // Outputs 15


How do you prevent SQL injection in PHP?
SQL injection is a common security vulnerability in web applications that use dynamic SQL queries. To prevent SQL injection in PHP, you can use prepared statements or parameterized queries instead of concatenating user input directly into a SQL query.
// Connect to the database
$conn = new mysqli("localhost", "username", "password", "database");
// Prepare a statement with a parameter
$stmt = $conn->prepare("SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = ?");
// Bind the parameter to a variable
$stmt->bind_param("s", $username);
// Set the parameter value
$username = "john";
// Execute the statement
$stmt->execute();
// Get the results
$result = $stmt->get_result();
while ($row = $result->fetch_assoc()) {
    echo $row["username"] . "<br>";
}
// Close the statement and the connection
$stmt->close();
$conn->close();


What is $this in PHP?
In PHP, $this is a special variable that refers to the current instance of a class. It can be used to access properties and methods of the class from within the class itself.

When a method is called on an object, $this refers to that object. This allows the method to access and modify the object's properties and call its methods.
class Person {
    private $name;
    
    public function setName($name) {
        $this->name = $name;
    }
    
    public function getName() {
        return $this->name;
    }
}

$person = new Person();
$person->setName("John");
echo $person->getName();   // Outputs "John"


Explain lifecycle and flow of nginx and php application?
The lifecycle and flow of an Nginx and PHP application can be described as follows:

1.User makes a request: When a user makes a request to the Nginx server, Nginx listens on the specified port (usually port 80 or 443 for HTTPS) and accepts the incoming connection.

2.Nginx processes the request: Nginx processes the request and tries to match the requested URL with one of the defined server blocks (virtual hosts). If a match is found, Nginx passes the request to the PHP-FPM process manager using FastCGI protocol.

PHP-FPM processes the request: PHP-FPM (FastCGI Process Manager) is responsible for managing and processing the PHP requests. It creates and manages multiple PHP-FPM child processes to handle incoming requests, based on the number of worker processes specified in its configuration.

PHP processes the request: Once the request is received by the PHP-FPM child process, it processes the PHP code and generates the HTML content or any other response that is required.

PHP-FPM sends the response to Nginx: Once the PHP code is executed, PHP-FPM sends the response back to Nginx using the FastCGI protocol.

Nginx sends the response to the user: Finally, Nginx sends the response to the user who made the request. If the response includes static content (e.g. CSS or images), Nginx serves them directly from its cache, avoiding the need to involve PHP-FPM.

Overall, the flow of a PHP application with Nginx is a multi-step process that involves multiple components working together. The request is first processed by Nginx, which then passes it on to PHP-FPM for processing. After processing, the response is sent back to Nginx and then finally to the user who made the request. This flow is critical to the efficient and reliable operation of a PHP application running on nginx.

In simple Words
A client sends an HTTP request to the Nginx server.
Nginx receives the request and examines the server block configuration to determine which PHP application should handle the request.
If the requested resource is a static file, Nginx serves it directly to the client. Otherwise, Nginx passes the request to the PHP application.
The PHP FastCGI process manager (FPM) receives the request from Nginx and spawns a PHP worker process to handle the request.
The PHP worker process executes the PHP script and generates an HTTP response.
The PHP worker process returns the response to the PHP FPM process.
The PHP FPM process returns the response to Nginx.
Nginx sends the response back to the client.
During this flow, Nginx can also perform various tasks such as load balancing, SSL termination, and caching to improve the performance and security of the PHP application. Additionally, PHP can handle database connections, session management, and other backend logic to generate dynamic content for the client.
